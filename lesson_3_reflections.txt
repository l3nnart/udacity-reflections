# When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
* when you want to share your project
* when you want to collaborate with others on this project
* when you want to have an off-side backup of your project
* when you work on different computers

# Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
* you wnt to keep full control on your project; maybe there are changes in the remote repo you don't want to be made in your project/in another branch etc.
* you want to be sure that there are no changes made on your local project which may interfere with changes you made

# Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
* fork: 	a clone of a repository made on github; used to clone s. o. else's project to work with this an a base but maybe not to collaboate directly
* clone: 	a copy of a repository, locally or remote; for example to get a remote repository to your local machine; collaboration intended
* branch: 	to implement new features, to separate version with a different approach (e. g. stable vs. experimental), to test something without the risk of breaking the working code...

# What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
* gives the possibility to easily merge with the changed remote repo once you have access to it again
